# Automated-Content-Summarizer-for-News-Articles
This project is a "Personalized News Summarizer" built with Streamlit. Users input preferences (country, category, source, role), and the app uses Googlesearch-Python to retrieve relevant news articles. It scrapes and summarizes articles with BeautifulSoup, and converts summaries into audio using gTTS for easy listening.
